# ðŸš€Welcome to my Ethical Hacking Portfolio! ðŸš€

This repository shows hands-on projects where Iâ€™ve tested and developed my skills in the area of cybersecurity. It includes also penetration testing / ethical hacking-related subrepositorios. I upload here quite frequently.

Subrepositorios:

- CiscoHacking
- EthicalHacking
- Pentesting
- PythonProjects

This portfolio have also python-related projects. Most of them are in finnish and school projects, but free to check them out!
As the cherry on top, I suggest taking a look at my[C2-project](https://github.com/JohnnyMaelstrm/C2Project). It is still a work-in-progress repository, but a really exciting project that I am working on.
