## 💻 Ethical Hacking Portfolio 💻


# 🚀Welcome to my Ethical Hacking Portfolio! 🚀

This repository showcases my work in cybersecurity, including penetration testing exercises, vulnerability assessments, and custom tools/scripts I've used to develop my ethical hacking skills. Each project reflects my hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating security risks.

🔐 Key Areas:

✔️ Network & Web Security
✔️ Exploiting & Hardening Systems
✔️ Penetration Testing & Red Teaming
✔️ Security Research & Custom Tools

This portfolio serves as both a learning journal and a demonstration of my practical skills in ethical hacking and also in penetration testing!
